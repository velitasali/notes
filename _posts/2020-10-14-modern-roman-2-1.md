Virginia Woolf, in her work _Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown_, describes the issues with Victorian writers.

What led to the rise of Modernism? Let's start with this question.

The writers shouldn't just aim at giving lessons. The main purpose of art is give something 

Naturalism is an extension of **realism**. It is the representation of life in a scientific manner. It is more pessimistic than realism, which can get us closer to modernism. You cannot always expect good things to come out in life. You cannot just change the direction of life. It doesn't matter who and where you are in life because there are **external forces** which you may not have control over. Education you have received and the sociocultural place you are in will determine who you are.

In this term, we will see that naturalism gives us pessimistic view of life. When we look at the second stage of **science-fiction**, we will see it is more closer to 

Modernism was affected by psycho-analysis (Freud) and scientific advancements. According to Freud, you are not driven by rational thought contrary to what you might think. Reason is not in-place and some part of brain which you are unconscious of leads you in life. There are 3 parts in brain. **Superego** is like a teacher or parent. It sets the rules. **Ego** mediates between superego and **id** that wants to fulfill desires. Freud suggested that id controls us. It is what causes trauma, defense mechanisms as you will push what can't control to the id side of brain.

Einstein's **Theory of Relativity** also affected this period (only the speed of light doesn't change). There is no absolute truth. We have different versions of reality appear in different forms to different people.

Post-expressionism expects that a representation to reflect the emotion and the attitude of the artist. It cares about the emotion the art invokes.

Although writers' works and their characters in their works were for for the society, they wanted to be left alone. This also created an inner conflict.

In the former scientific view, the World is knowable and predictable. This was replaced by the new scientific findings which suggested that not everything is predictable/knowable. This caused anxiety.

Virginia Woolf says ordinary mind on an ordinary day can be part of the literature. It could attach a work to the reality.

When we look at the Victorian era, the idea of self revolves around a stable ego, meaning the internal conflict is not there. In Modernism, this changed to problematic, unknowable, complex state of mind. The mind like everything is in **flux** (ever-changing).

Religion and history were replaced by mythology. For instance, due to WWI and WWII, people felt hopeless as their request for help from God were not answered. This led to decay in the faith in God. In other words, religion and God lost its meaning. 

Carl Jung suggested that humanity has a collective unconscious.
