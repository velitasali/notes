## Decadence

They were influenced by the artistic movement. They were trying to remove the influence the society has on art. Because they are individualist, the sense of self is important to them. 

## Surrealism

It was largely influenced by Dadaism. It focuses on mind and unconsciousness. They use symbols and images. They try to eliminate the difference between conscious and unconscious. To them, we are not driven by rationality.

## Expressionism

Scream, the painting.

## Virginia Woolf

### Materialists

According to Woolf, they are the writers who are depicting the outside world and not including the inside world of a person.

### Spiritualists

The modern writers using stream-of-consciousness.

## Epiphany

A sudden, intuitive perception of or insight into the reality or essential meaning of something, usually initiated by some simple, homely, or commonplace occurrence or experience.

## Grand Narratives

Narrative knowledge is knowledge in the form of story-telling. In the tribal times, myths and legends formed knowledge of this type; that such-and-such a mountain was just where it was because some mythic animal put it there, and so on. The narrative not only explained, but legitimated knowledge, and when applied to the social relations of their own society, the myths functioned as a legitimization of the existing power relations, customs and so on.

During the start of the modern times. According to modernists, the established understanding of life has connections to these narratives which it should detach from.
