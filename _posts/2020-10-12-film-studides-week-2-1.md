I don't know what this class is about. This is the first-time I am attending it. Hoping for the best.

There will be a quiz at the end of the class, says Mr. İpşirli.

The topic is a YouTube Video (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFkSjdaqbyE>). 

Hugo Münsterberg (1863-1916)

> The mind locates patterns in the colors, smells, tastes, sounds and feeling it perceives and organizes the individual's sense of the world.

> Film could distort space and time. 

> On the one hand, the medium was literally two-dimensional, with flat images projected onto a flat screen, but on the other there was an illusion of space.

> Film could take the viewer to a limitless number of locations.

> He suggested that the brain has a phi-phenomenon in which the mind controls what it perceives, and fills in the gaps between perceptions.

> Just as music is the art form of the ear and painting the art form of the eye, so film is the art of the mind.

For instance, if you were to draw pictures on a notebook each of which is the next stage of what it succeeds and flip them at the right speed, it will seem as if it is moving. In other words, the brain will complete the images and make it seem so.

Vsevold Pudovkin (1893-1953)

> Pudovkin assumes that the reaction of an audience is predictable. We associate emotions with our body language and using this method, conveying an emotion with our body language in a film can make it seem as though it is emotions themselves even though they may be not. For that reason, a director's job is that of a technician.

> Equally, an abstract theme or symbolism could link two elements. Two narrative can be linked together by editing to make them appear simultaneous - such as showing both sides in a chase sequence. It’s not that we see the different scenes simultaneously, but that we hold them in our minds simultaneously. Finally, there is editing which depends on a recurring visual leitmotif, an object, shape or style of lighting recurring through a film.

Sergei Eisenstein (1898–1948)

There are 5 different montage styles.
