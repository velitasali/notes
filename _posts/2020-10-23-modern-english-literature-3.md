Paul, Hester's son, is aware that his mother doesn't love him or his sisters. His father is an unsuccessful and unlucky middle-class man whose only objective is to earn more money. The family is living on a high standard, more than they could actually afford, and Hester thinks, by marrying an unsuccessful husband, she also became unlucky. Paul wants to fix this and tells his mother that he is not unlucky. 

The house is haunted by voices whispering "There must be more money". On one Christmas eve, Paul gets a rocking-horse. This increases the voices whispering. 

At some point, again, Paul's uncle, Oscar Creswell, learns that Paul is able predict horses that will win in race, and he has been working with the gardener, Bassett, sharing prizes.

In Freudian Psychoanalysis, a successful father figure is what ends Oedipus Complex and help a boy move on with his life. In this story, we don't see it.
