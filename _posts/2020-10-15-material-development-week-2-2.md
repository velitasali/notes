## 2.1 Introduction

* Methodology and material design that have influenced the changes and innovations in English Language teaching in recent years.

* _Communicative approach_ with its underlying principles as they constitute the foundation for the approaches and materials that have followed.

## 2.2 Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) and Its Influences

The communicative approach challenged the prevailing structural view of language and language teaching in the 1960s.

Innovated many aspects of course desiring, incorporating insights into language use, language learning and teaching from the 1970s to early 1980.

Some of the principles of the communicative approach have come to be an explicit or implicit part of English language teaching in the everyday professional lives of teachers in many parts of the world.

Communicative design criteria permeate both general coursebooks and material covering specific language skills as well as methodology of the classroom.

### CLT Approach

> A diverse set of principle that reflect a communicative view of language and language learning and that can be used to support a wide variety of classroom procedures (Richards and Rodgers, 2001:172).

#### Richards and Rodgers (2001) identify 3 stages.

1. In its first phase, a primary concern was the need to develop a syllabus that was compatible with the notion of communicative competence. This led to proposals for the organization of syllabuses in terms of notions and functions rather than grammatical structures (Wilkins, 1976).

2. In the second phase, according to Munby (1978), CLT focused on procedures for identifying learners's needs and this resulted in proposals to make needs analysis an essential component of communicative methodology.

3. In the third phase, CLT focused on the kinds of classroom activities that could be used as the basis of a communicative methodology, such as group work, task-work, and information gap activities (Prabhu, 1987).

##### Implication 1

* Wilkins proposed two categories of communicative meaning: **notional** (or **semantico-grammatical**) and **functional**.

* **Notions** are rather abstract concepts—frequency, duration, dimension, location, quantity and so on.

* **Functions**, refer to the practical uses to which we put language, most usually in interaction with other people.

###### How do teaching materials handle the relationship between grammar and communicative function?

If they followed a traditional grammar syllabus, how should functions be incorporated?

* The same sentence could have various functions, depending on how it is used.

* If the main spine of the syllabus is based on communicative functions, each function would involve different grammatical expressions.

* The complex relationships between grammar and communicative functions may be too overwhelming for beginners or learners with low proficiency.

##### Implication 2

* Real-world languages in use do not operate in a vacuum, and this is the second implication of the communicative approach.

* Talking about language function and language form, there are other dimensions of communication to be considered if we are to be offered a more complete picture.

There are;

* Topics
* Context or setting
* Roles of people involved

##### Implication 3 (Error Types)

It is undoubtedly desirable that their language production should be as correct as possible, but we have seen that grammaticality also takes place in a wider social and communicative context.

| A: _Give me a ticket to London!_ |
| B: _Send me your prospectus!_  `false` | B: _Please could you to send me your prospectus?_ `true` |

Concept of error is no longer limited to **incorrect grammar** or **word choice**. Being communicative involve **context**, **roles**, **issues**.

##### Implication 4 (Discourse - Coherence & Cohesive)

* In recent years, a number of categories for describing language have been developed that are not based on sentence-level criteria, but on the broader notion of **discourse**.

* How different parts of a text or speech of language are interconnected.

| The taxi driver | He |
| Two girls | They |
| "Which ice-cream would you like?" | "I like the pink one." |
| cohesion |

**Coherence** is about whether a text as a whole _makes sense_ or not.

##### Implication 5 (Four Language Skills)

The term **communicative** can in fact refer to all four language skills.

1. Productive, speaking and writing.

2. Receptive, listening and reading.

3. Oral/aural skills, speaking and listening.

4. Paper skills, writing and reading.

The **giver and receive** of a message is the means in which the information in a message is understood. 

![How communication occur](/assets/communicative-language-teaching-4-language-skills-1.jpg)

* Languages seem to have inherent communicative as well as grammatical properties.

* A communicative approach also implies a concern with behavior, patterns of interaction as well as linguistic content.

Morrow (1981)

**What:** the contents of a language programme.
**How:** the ways in which that content might be learned and taught.

Writing a letter, or an essay, or talking to a friend, at a meeting, to a stranger.

1. CLT means not teaching grammar.
2. CLT means teaching only speaking.
3. CLT means pair-work, which means role play.
4. CLT means expecting too much from the teacher.

###### Conclusion

1. The concept of **being communicative** includes what a language has the potential to mean, as well grammar properties.

2. Real-world language in use does not operate in a vacuum.

3. The communicative approach concerns with the error types.

4. A concept of communication does not have to be based on sentence-level criteria, it can allow language to be described, and language learning to take  place, over longer stretches.

5. Communicative can in fact refer to all four language skills.

6. There is distinction between the **what** and the **how**.

## 2.3 Some Claims for Current Materials

When discussing developments in material design after CLT, an obvious question is whether the influences can be detected in current materials after many debates and the test of time. Nunan (1999: 2) thinks that "contemporary practice represents and evolution, and... the best practice incorporates the best of 'traditional' practice rather than rejecting it."

"It enables you to learn English as it is used in our globalized world, to learn through English using information-rich topics, and to learn about English as an international language. ... offers a comprehensive range of interactive digital components for use in class, out of class and even on the move. These include extra listening, video material and online practice." (Clandfield and Jeffries, 2010)

"With its wide range of support materials, it meets the diverse needs of learners in a variety of teaching situations an helps to bridge the gap between the classroom and the real world." (Clare and Wilson, 2011)
