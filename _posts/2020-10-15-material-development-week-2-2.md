## 2.1 Introduction

* Methodology and material design that have influenced the changes and innovations in English Language teaching in recent years.

* **Communicative approach** with its underlying principles as they constitute the foundation for the approaches and materials that have followed.

## 2.2 Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) and Its Influences

The communicative approach challenged the prevailing structural view of language and language teaching in the 1960s.

Innovated many aspects of course desiring, incorporating insights into language use, language learning and teaching from the 1970s to early 1980.

Some of the principles of the communicative approach have come to be an **explicit** or **implicit** part of English language teaching in the everyday professional lives of teachers in many parts of the world.

Communicative design criteria permeate both general coursebooks and material covering specific language skills as well as methodology of the classroom.

### CLT Approach

> A diverse set of principle that reflect a communicative view of language and language learning and that can be used to support a wide variety of classroom procedures (Richards and Rodgers, 2001:172).

#### Richards and Rodgers (2001) identify 3 stages.

1. In its first phase, a primary concern was the need to develop a syllabus that was compatible with the notion of communicative competence. This led to proposals for the organization of syllabuses in terms of notions and functions rather than grammatical structures (Wilkins, 1976).

2. In the second phase, CLT focused on procedures for identifying learners's needs and this resulted in proposals to make needs analysis an essential component of communicative methodology (Munby, 1978).

3. In the third phase, CLT focused on the kinds of classroom activities that could be used as the basis of a communicative methodology, such as group work, task-work, and information gap activities (Prabhu, 1987).

##### Implication 1

* Wilkins proposed two categories of communicative meaning: **notional** (or **semantico-grammatical**) and **functional**.

* **Notions** are rather abstract concepts—frequency, duration, dimension, location, quantity and so on.

* **Functions**, refer to the practical uses to which we put language, most usually in interaction with other people.

###### How do teaching materials handle the relationship between grammar and communicative function?

If they followed a traditional grammar syllabus, how should functions be incorporated?

* The same sentence could have various functions, depending on how it is used.

* If the main spine of the syllabus is based on communicative functions, each function would involve different grammatical expressions.

* The complex relationships between grammar and communicative functions may be too overwhelming for beginners or learners with low proficiency.

##### Implication 2

* Real-world languages in use do not operate in a vacuum, and this is the second implication of the communicative approach.

* Talking about language function and language form, there are other dimensions of communication to be considered if we are to be offered a more complete picture.

There are;

* Topics
* Context or setting
* Roles of people involved

##### Implication 3 (Error Types)

It is undoubtedly desirable that their language production should be as correct as possible, but we have seen that grammaticality also takes place in a wider social and communicative context.

| A: _Give me a ticket to London!_ |
| B: _Send me your prospectus!_  `false` | B: _Please could you to send me your prospectus?_ `true` |

Concept of error is no longer limited to **incorrect grammar** or **word choice**. Being communicative involve **context**, **roles**, **issues**.

##### Implication 4 (Discourse - Coherence & Cohesive)

* In recent years, a number of categories for describing language have been developed that are not based on sentence-level criteria, but on the broader notion of **discourse**.

* How different parts of a text or speech of language are interconnected.

| The taxi driver | He |
| Two girls | They |
| "Which ice-cream would you like?" | "I like the pink one." |
| cohesion |

**Coherence** is about whether a text as a whole _makes sense_ or not.

##### Implication 5 (Four Language Skills)

The term **communicative** can in fact refer to all four language skills.

1. Productive, speaking and writing.

2. Receptive, listening and reading.

3. Oral/aural skills, speaking and listening.

4. Paper skills, writing and reading.

The **giver and receive** of a message is the means in which the informaiton in a message is understood. 

![How communication occur](/assets/communicative-language-teaching-4-language-skills-1.jpg)

* Lnaguages seem to have inherent communicative as well as grammatical properties.

* A communicatiove approach also implies a concern with behavior, patterns of interaction as well as linguistic content.

Morrow (1981)
