A knowledge dumping ground (in a good way). 

Use **find** to filter entries by categories, tags, and titles.

## Motivation

Information should be traceable, reproducible, and easy-to-access because making it so is easy.

I could have written on a paper, and it would still be a usable piece, but it wouldn't be easily accessible or traceable and we should all be against that.

The effort we put into creating these is immense and not using the most effective medium to store them may not be a good idea because time is an important resource. Also, you will always need your notes and this assures that you can copy, edit, and share in no time.
