hi, there! i am veli tasalÄ±. i am tired of writing about sections, so let me sort this out quickly. 

i always need something to take notes but could not find a better way of organizing things. i tried google classroom and now using it, but not for taking notes. for that, i will use here. the lovely markdown format should make the note taking process a breeze. 

i am studying english literature btw. 

last year, i took a break because i had something else in mind, and this year that took over everything and now just want to get my degree and move on.

thank you for paying attention. i love you.
